# Figue Theme

**⚠ Please note, this theme is still a work in progress, your feedback will be very welcome!**

A soothing dark and vibrant light theme for Visual Studio Code, inspired by the rich colors of figs and the sun-drenched Mediterranean landscape.

## Overview

* **Figue Theme Night:** A dark theme that prioritizes reduced eye strain with a warm, yellowish base and pops of fig-inspired purples, greens, and browns for syntax highlighting.
* **Figue Theme Morning:** A bright and airy theme that maintains readability with a soft yellow undertone, accented by the vibrant hues of ripe figs.

The goal of Figue Theme is to create a harmonious visual environment that is both easy on the eyes and aesthetically pleasing, drawing inspiration from the natural beauty of the Mediterranean.

## Features

* **Dual Theme Support:** Includes both a thoughtfully crafted dark mode and a vibrant light mode.
* **Reduced Eye Strain:** The yellowish base palette in both themes aims to minimize eye fatigue during long coding sessions.
* **Fig-Inspired Colors:** Syntax highlighting incorporates colors reminiscent of different fig varieties – from deep purples and rich browns to subtle greens and rosy hues – creating a coherent and visually interesting experience.
* **Mediterranean Inspiration:** The overall color choices evoke the warmth and vibrancy of the Mediterranean, bringing a touch of that atmosphere to your coding environment.
* **Work in Progress:** This theme is actively being developed and refined, with ongoing improvements and potential new features.
